<p>Hello, my name is Lydia Zvyagintseva, and I am a librarian with the Edmonton Public Library.  
Having figured out a plan for a new technology service, I am now working on implementing it as the Digital Exhibits Librarian. 
I am also the co-founder and co-lead for the digital civic engagement group called Beta City YEG, supporting an ongoing roster of projects and initiatives making Edmonton a better, more livable, smarter city. I like data, hiphop, UFC, and weightlifting. 
I mostly keep this site to keep track of presentations and projects. 
The best way to find me is on Twitter. 
Feel free to connect if you have a question or an idea to share. Thanks!</p>
